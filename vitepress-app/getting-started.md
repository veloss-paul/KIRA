## 🎯 Choose Your Mode

KIRA can be used in two different modes. **Choose your preferred mode first.**

<img src="/images/screenshots/mode-comparison.png" alt="Bot Mode vs Virtual Coworker Mode" style="max-width: 550px; width: 100%;" />

::: info Mode Comparison
| Feature | Bot Mode | Virtual Coworker Mode |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Installation** | Your computer | Dedicated computer/VM/server |
| **Slack Account** | Your account or bot app | Dedicated account for AI |
| **Token** | Bot Token (`xoxb-...`) | User Token (`xoxp-...`) |
| **Display** | Shows as a bot | Shows as a real user |
| **Uptime** | When your computer is on | 24/7 (always on) |
| **Operator** | You | Independent operation |
| **Setup** | Easy | Slightly complex |
:::

> 💡 **KRAFTON Use Case**: KRAFTON provides a dedicated company account and computer to run KIRA as a virtual coworker, just like onboarding a new hire.

### 🤖 Bot Mode

**Use KIRA as a personal AI assistant on your computer.**

- Install KIRA on **your computer**
- Use **your Slack account** or bot app
- You manage and operate it directly
- Stops when your computer is off

**Best for:**

- Using AI assistant alone
- Quick and simple setup

### 👤 Virtual Coworker Mode

**Run KIRA as a team-shared AI coworker on a dedicated computer.**

- Install KIRA on a **dedicated computer** (or VM/server)
- Create a **dedicated Slack account** for the AI (e.g., "KIRA Kim")
- Runs 24/7 independently
- Participates in channels like a real team member

**Best for:**
- Team-wide shared AI coworker
- 24/7 always-on operation
- Operating like a real team member

::: warning Choose Your Mode Before Proceeding
This guide has different setup steps depending on your chosen mode. Follow the **Bot Mode** or **Virtual Coworker Mode** instructions at each step.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

### 1. Slack Workspace
- A personal workspace or one where you have admin permissions
- Free plan works fine

### 2. Node.js
- Node.js 18 or higher installed
- Required for Claude Code CLI
- [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### 3. Computer Requirements
- **macOS**: 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- Free disk space: 500MB or more

### 4. Claude Pro Plan
- KIRA uses Claude Code internally, which requires a **Claude Pro plan or higher**
- [Learn more about Claude plans](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing)

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Install Required Tools

Install the necessary tools before running the KIRA app.

### 1. Install Claude Code CLI

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

::: danger Don't use sudo!
**Never use `sudo npm install -g`**. Using sudo can cause npm cache permission issues that will prevent MCP servers from connecting later.

If you get permission errors, fix permissions first:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin
```
Then run `npm install -g` without sudo.

If you already installed with sudo, see [Troubleshooting - MCP Server Connection Issues](/troubleshooting#mcp-servers-show-failed-status).
:::

Verify installation:
```bash
claude --version
```

### 2. Install mcp-cache (Optional)

If you plan to use the **Computer Use (Playwright)** feature, install mcp-cache:

```bash
npm install -g @hapus/mcp-cache
```

::: tip What is mcp-cache?
mcp-cache reduces startup time and cache size for MCP servers. It's only required for the Computer Use feature.
:::

### 3. Log in to Claude

**Important**: After installing Claude Code CLI, you must log in first:

```bash
claude
```

When you run the `claude` command:
1. A browser window will open automatically
2. Log in with your Anthropic account (or create one)
3. After authentication, you'll see a confirmation message in terminal
4. You can exit the terminal - your login session persists

::: warning First-Time Setup Required
KIRA uses the Claude Agent SDK internally, so you must complete this login step before starting KIRA. If you skip this step, KIRA won't be able to use Claude AI.
:::

::: tip What is Claude Code CLI?
It's the CLI tool used internally by the Claude Agent SDK, which powers KIRA's AI engine.
:::

### 4. uv (Python Package Manager) - Auto-installed

::: tip Automatic Installation
uv is **automatically installed** when you first start KIRA. If uv is not detected, a dialog will appear asking if you want to install it automatically.
:::

If automatic installation fails, you can install it manually:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Verify installation:
```bash
uv --version
```

::: info What is uv?
uv is a fast Python package manager. KIRA uses it to automatically install and manage required Python libraries.

## 🧠 Build Memory (Recommended)

To use KIRA more effectively, it's recommended to build memory initially.

Pre-load team member info, organization structure, project info, Confluence documents, etc.:
- Auto-recognize email addresses without tagging team members
- Auto-reference project context
- Use information instantly without searching documents

::: tip Memory Initialization Guide
For detailed memory building instructions, see the [Memory System](/features/memory#memory-initialization-guide) page.
