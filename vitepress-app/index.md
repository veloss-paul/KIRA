## 💡 What is KIRA?

> **KIRA** = **K**RAFTON **I**NTELLIGENCE **R**OOKIE **A**GENT

KIRA is an open-source project that repackages **KRIS (KRAFTON Intelligence System)**—an AI agent system successfully used internally at KRAFTON—into a "virtual coworker" concept that anyone can install and use as a standalone desktop application. No servers, no cloud setup, just install and go.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Getting started with KIRA is really simple:

1. **Download the app**: Download the macOS installer
2. **Install**: Install it like any regular app
3. **Connect Slack**: Open the app and just enter your Slack tokens!

::: tip macOS Only
KIRA currently supports macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later only.

## 💡 Who is this for?

KIRA is built for **non-developers**:

- **Marketers**: Automate daily reports, manage social media
- **Sales**: Extract email tasks, manage customer information
- **Planners**: Track document updates, organize meeting notes
- **Founders**: An AI assistant for all your work

No technical knowledge required. It's as easy as installing Microsoft Office.
